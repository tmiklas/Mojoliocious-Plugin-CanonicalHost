Mojoliocious-Plugin-CanonicalHost
=================================

Mojolicious::Plugin::CanonicalHost

This plugin was designed only to handle redirects from all wired host names
bound to the IP address where your Mojolicious app runs to one name only.
Typical example - www.domain.tld or domain.tld? It may be hard to choose, 
but will be easy to enforce.

Hints:
- Google doesn't like 'duplicate content'
